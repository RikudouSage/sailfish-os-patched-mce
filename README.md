# Patched MCE for Xperia 10 III

This `mce` is patched to allow the use of the assistant button. The button is mapped to the home key, meaning by default it will take you to your homescreen.

This package also installs additional patches for patch manager which allow you to override the behavior of home button (and thus the assistant button which is mapped to the home button) to toggle flashlight.
