# Patched MCE for Xperia 10 III

### Warning: This is a system component, if you install it incorrectly you may brick your system. This has only been tested on the versions mentioned below. Only ever install the linked packages on the correct system version.

This `mce` is patched to allow the use of the assistant button. The button is mapped to the home key, meaning by default it will take you to your homescreen.

This package also installs additional patches for patch manager which allow you to override the behavior of home button (and thus the assistant button which is mapped to the home button) to toggle flashlight.
